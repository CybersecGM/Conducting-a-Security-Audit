# Conducting-a-Security-Audit (Botium Toys - Cyberecurity Audit & Improvement Plan)

## Project Overview:

This project involved a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment for the fictional company, ***Botium Toys***. The primary goal was to analyze their existing security posture, identify vulnerabilities, and recommend actionable steps for improvement, particularly concerning their handling of sensitive data and compliance requirements.

## Process & Methodology:

**-Initial Assessment:** I reviewed the [Botium Toys' risk assessment report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DIUSNPDelAgPOgVkeCpJQUHUEXjCk3U5gz1rGBMRyqQ/edit?tab=t.0) and utilized a [security controls guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tq_0eCgcnFa4TZVxts1C1rh7xY_2pf521y0HktnA6vk/edit?usp=sharing) to complete a compliance and controls checklist. This helped me to clearly identify existing security measures and significant gaps.

**-AI-Powered Analysis & Verification:** I leveraged an advanced AI tool to independently analyze the provided company documents (scope, risk assessment, control categories) and generate a comparative checklist. This cross-verification process was crucial in identifying initial oversights in my manual assessment. For example, I initially missed that "[the IT department did have a plan to notify E.U. customers of breaches within 72 hours  and that they enforced privacy policies to document and maintain data.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2abe009-1750-4c32-b1ec-685500113c98)" Using AI for verification enhanced the accuracy of my judgment, allowing for further investigation and correction of these initial misinterpretations.

**-Stakeholder Reporting:** I developed a concise and professional summary for Botium Toys' stakeholders and upper management. This report highlighted the current security standing, areas needing immediate attention, and a clear path forward, including:
 
 **Creating a Risk Assessment Matrix to weigh vulnerability likelihood against impact severity.*
 
 **Prioritizing changes to address critical issues first and minimize operational impact.*
 
 **Focusing on achieving and maintaining compliance with industry standards.*

 **Implementing necessary security controls to protect against internal and external threats.*

## Outcome:

The result was an easy-to-understand report for Botium Toys' stakeholders, pinpointing areas where security controls were lacking and outlining a strategic approach to enhance their overall security posture and ensure compliance. The integration of AI tools served as a valuable validation step, improving the accuracy and completeness of the final recommendations.
